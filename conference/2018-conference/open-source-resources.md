## Go Proxy and Registry (Athens)
*Go*
[GitHub](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
Project Athens is going to be the official Go proxy and registry, and works with the new Go Modules feature in the Go 1.11 beta. This is similar to what other languages already have, for instance ruby gems or npm. Not only will it let you register a package, but it can be used as a proxy (or cache) so that you are protected from packages disappearing from the internet, or github outages.

We are actively seeking feedback from brand new Go developers, so everyone is welcome!

## Kubernetes
